# Simple Animations Android

This repository contains an Android application project demonstrating the use of simple animations. The app focuses on implementing battery animations and provides an excellent example of how to use Android's animation framework to create smooth and visually appealing effects.

## About the Project

The **Simple Animations Android** project was created to:
- Demonstrate the basics of Android animations.
- Provide a starting point for developers to explore animation features in Android.
- Showcase an interactive and visually engaging animation for user interfaces.

## Features
